## AInimal Go! - Interact with the Animal Kingdom through AI

Welcome to "AInimal Go!", an innovative application inspired by the charm of Pokémon Go, crafted for animal lovers and technology aficionados. This unique app bridges the gap between the digital world and the animal kingdom, allowing users to upload or capture images of animals and engage in interactive, text-based conversations with them, powered by advanced AI technologies.

### Key Features:

- **Image Upload & Capture:** Seamlessly upload an image from your gallery or use the in-app camera to snap a picture of an animal.
- **ResNet Image Classification:** Utilizes the ResNet model for accurate identification of various animal species from the uploaded images.
- **AI-Driven Conversations:** Engage in text-based chats with animals through a role-playing Large Language Model (LLM), bringing a personalized and imaginative touch to each interaction.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive design and simple navigation enhance the user experience, making animal interaction accessible to everyone.

### How it Works:

1. **Capture or Upload:** Begin by capturing a new image or uploading an existing one of an animal.
2. **Animal Identification:** The app uses the ResNet model to analyze the image and identify the animal species.
3. **Engage in Conversation:** The identified animal species is then used to initiate a conversation. Our LLM, equipped with conversational capabilities, role-plays as the animal, allowing for a unique chatting experience.
4. **Interactive Chat Interface:** Users can ask questions or chat freely with the AI-represented animal, receiving responses that are imaginative, informative, and engaging.

### Technologies Used:

- Streamlit for the web interface.
- ResNet for image classification.
- PaLM LLM for generating conversational responses.
- Replicate and Google APIs for model integration and deployment.
